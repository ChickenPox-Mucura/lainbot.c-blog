			<h2>Day 1</h2>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">Tweaking with html and CSS has been a fun experience. A few more
			   days and i'll have a nice looking blog to post about my not-so-interesting life.
			   This is a project i wanted to do since i became conscious of my web pesantry,
			   and it is nearing completion, provided i get a domain soon!</p>
			<h2>Day 2</h2>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">Still building the site. Learned how to make a simple fixed sidebar to place
			   some links redirecting nowhere.</p>

				width="350">
				<figcaption style="color:#111;font-size:13px"><i>My CGI home</i></figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h2>Day 3 (i guess...)</h2>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">Time to shake the dust off this derelict "blog". It's important to learn something new everyday,
			but i feel like i'm just watching life pass by.</p>

			</figure>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">I'm beginning to question the need for me to have a blog. Up to this point i've tried countless times to keep 
			a diary, without any success, because i'm simply unable to write anything about myself. Well, at least i'll learn some html all right... 
			(edit)... But! I accepted a good suggestion. I'll make this more of log to keep track of the things i learn, everyday, no matter how
			insignificant they may seem. This way, it will be useful and (hopefully) fun.</p>

			<h2>Day 4</h2>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">Today i learned something very useful, althought i won't need it any time soon. It is about traffic; about
			driving.</p>
			<p style="margin: 20px;">First of all i don't like the idea about driving very much. I was never amused by it, except sometimes
			when i see an old car of my liking (think about a Volkswagen Kombi or a Brazilian Gurgel for example). Perhaps it's not the driving 
			<i>itself</i>, it may be the (excruciating) process of getting a license instead. Anyway, what i learned is that if you're driving a bus,
			and are about to take a turn in a narrow street in which another bus is coming towards you, instead of actually carefully taking the turn, 
			you should go straight or backwards and then wait for the other bus to go on it's way and only then you can go forward or 
			backwards again and proceed to turning.</p>
